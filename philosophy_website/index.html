                    <h4>Biography</h4>
                    <p>Friedrich Nietzsche was born in 1844 in Röcken, Germany. After a brilliant academic career that led to his appointment as a professor of classical philology at the University of Basel at just 24 years old, Nietzsche developed health problems that forced his retirement. He spent the next decade producing his most significant philosophical works before suffering a mental collapse in 1889.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Key Works</h4>

                    <h4>Philosophical Approach</h4>
                    <p>Nietzsche's philosophical style is distinctive and often challenging, featuring aphoristic writing, perspectivism, psychological analysis, and cultural criticism. He rejected creating a systematic philosophy, preferring a more experimental approach.</p>
