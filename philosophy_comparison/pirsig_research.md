# Robert M. Pirsig's Philosophy

## Metaphysics of Quality (MOQ)

The Metaphysics of Quality (MOQ) is a theory of reality introduced by Robert M. Pirsig in his philosophical novel "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" (1974) and expanded in "Lila: An Inquiry into Morals" (1991). The MOQ incorporates facets of Sophistry, East Asian philosophy, pragmatism, and Indigenous American philosophy.

### Key Concepts

#### Quality
- "Quality," or "value," as described by Pirsig, cannot be defined because it empirically precedes any intellectual construction of it
- Quality exists as a perceptual experience before it is ever thought of descriptively or academically
- Quality is the "knife-edge" of experience, found only in the present
- Pirsig equates Quality with the Tao, postulating that Quality is the fundamental force in the universe stimulating everything from atoms to animals to evolve and incorporate ever greater levels of Quality
- According to the MOQ, everything (including ideas and matter) is a product and a result of Quality

#### Static and Dynamic Quality
- The MOQ maintains that Quality itself is undefinable (like the Tao), but to better understand it, Pirsig breaks quality down into two forms:
  1. **Dynamic Quality**: The pre-intellectual cutting edge of reality, recognized before it can be conceptualized
     - Cannot be defined according to East Asian philosophers and American Indian mystics
     - Can only be understood intellectually through the use of analogy
     - Described as "the force of change in the universe"
  
  2. **Static Quality Patterns**: Everything which can be defined
     - When an aspect of Quality becomes repeated, it becomes static
     - Everything found in a dictionary is a static quality pattern
     - Divided into four levels in ascending order of morality (based on evolutionary order):
       1. **Inorganic patterns**: Non-living things
       2. **Biological patterns**: Living things
       3. **Social patterns**: Behaviors, habits, rituals, institutions
       4. **Intellectual patterns**: Ideas

#### Evolution as Moral Progression
- Pirsig describes evolution as the moral progression of these patterns of value
- A biological pattern overcoming an inorganic pattern (e.g., bird flight which overcomes gravity) is a moral thing because a biological pattern is a higher form of evolution
- An intellectual pattern of value overcoming a social one (e.g., civil rights) is a moral development because intellect is a higher form of evolution than society

## Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance

Published in 1974, this philosophical novel is a fictionalized autobiography of a 17-day journey that Pirsig made with his Honda CB77 motorcycle from Minnesota to Northern California along with his son Chris in 1968.

### Key Themes

#### Romantic vs. Classical Understanding
- The narrator describes the "romantic" consideration of life of his friend, John Sutherland, who chooses not to learn how to maintain his expensive new motorcycle
- In contrast, the "classical" narrator has an older motorcycle which he is usually able to diagnose and repair himself through the use of rational problem-solving skills
- This dichotomy between romantic and classical understanding is central to Pirsig's philosophy

#### Quality as a Unifying Concept
- The narrator examines the modern pursuit of "Pure Truths," claiming it derives from the work of early Greek philosophers who were establishing the concept of truth in opposition to the force of "The Good"
- He argues that although rational thought may find a truth (or The Truth) it may never be applicable completely and universally to every individual's experience
- Pirsig makes a case that originally the Greeks did not distinguish between "Quality" and "Truth"â€”they were one and the same, arete
- The divorce between Quality and Truth was artificial (though needed at the time) and is now a source of much frustration and unhappiness in the world

#### Integration of Rational and Romantic
- The narrator explains that he seeks a perception of the world that embraces both the rational and the romantic
- He seeks to demonstrate that rationality and Zen-like "being in the moment" can harmoniously coexist
- Such a combination of rationality and romanticism can potentially result in a greater quality of life

## Connection to Nietzsche

It has been noted that Pirsig's romantic/classical dichotomy resembles Nietzsche's Dionysian/Apollonian dichotomy as described in "The Birth of Tragedy." For example, Edward Smith writes in his book "The Person of the Therapist":

> "In his popular novel ... Pirsig also addressed the Apollonian and Dionysian worldviews, naming them respectively classical understanding and romantic understanding."

This connection between Pirsig and Nietzsche's philosophical frameworks provides a foundation for exploring their common thoughts and philosophical approaches.

## Key Quotes

- "When he wrote it he felt momentary fright and was about to strike out the words 'All of it. Every last bit of it.' Madness there. I think he saw it. But he couldn't see any logical reason to strike these words out and it was too late now for faintheartedness. He ignored his warning and let the words stand." - ZMM, Ch.20

- "Good is a noun. That was it. That was what Phaedrus had been looking for. That was the homer, over the fence, that ended the ball game. Good as a noun rather than as an adjective is all the Metaphysics of Quality is about. Of course, the ultimate Quality isn't a noun or an adjective or anything else definable, but if you had to reduce the whole Metaphysics of Quality to a single sentence, that would be it." - Lila, The End

- "Another immoral way of killing the static patterns is to pass the patterns to someone else, in what Phaedrus called a 'karma dump.' ... If you take all this karmic garbage and make yourself feel better by passing it on to others that's normal. That's the way the world works. But if you manage to absorb it and not pass it on, that's the highest moral conduct of all." - Lila, Ch.32
